Some old stories &amp; immature code dating back to 2012 &amp; earlier. It used to be my off-class activity since 2010, when I was in senior high school.  
**The Project is No Longer Alive Now.**  
It contains a set of XML Schemas and object model which aims to implement a lyrics app (or a plugin, but I've not reached that stage.), which can convey richer information than the current .lrc files, including  
* a more precise time control for each word,
* the ability to distinguish different singers (or performers),
* translations (of course it's preset content, not MT or other real-time things),
* and even phonetic lyrics (e.g. Latinized Japanese).

The UI of this app is based on WPF, and most code was written in VB.NET. I've to say that I know nothing about software engineering and the object model hasn't been properly designed. I just code as I feel like to.  

I think the name of each project contained in the solution is self-descriptive. So... eh...

Btw, **a simple .NET analogy of Document-View Model is also provided**.  
Plz forgive me for a stunning lack of documentation & annotations. 基本上所有的注释和UI使用的都是简体中文, if any.
